# Captioner

Simple image caption manager.

I needed an easy way to see the caption and the image I am captioning at the same time, so I made this.

## Features

- Adjustable UI panes
- Subfolder support
- Remembers changes in multiple files (you can save them at once)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `PageUp` (or `ArrowUp` when caption is not focused) - Open previous image in folder
- `PageDown` (or `ArrowDown` when caption is not focused) - Open next image in folder
- `Ctrl`+`S` - Save currently open caption
- `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`S` - Save all unsaved captions

## Installation

// TODO

## Development 

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm dev`
